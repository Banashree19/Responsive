<p>
    Responsive comes with a series of jQuery plugins and methods that provide common webpage components in a responsive format.
</p>
<p>
    All plugins come with a markup API that allows running the plugin without writing a single line of JavaScript.
    This is Responsive's first class API and should be your first consideration when using a plugin.
</p>
<p>Each plugin has also been built to be extensible, providing events that can be tapped into to allow you to further enhance your site.</p>

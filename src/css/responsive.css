/*
 * Responsive framework
 *
 * Responsive is a minimalist framework for rapidly creating responsive websites specifically 
 * written to prevent the need to undo styles set by the framework itself and allow 
 * developers to write streamlined code.
 *
 * Portions of this CSS and JS are based on the incredibly hard work that has been 
 * done creating the HTML5 Boilerplate, Twitter Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation, and Normalize.css 
 * and all credit for that work is due to them.
 *

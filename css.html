<p>
    Responsive differs from other CSS frameworks in that it is built specifically not to force opinionated design on the developer.
    Instead we've jam-packed it with useful functionality to allow you to build a truly cross-browser responsive experience: Grids, forms, buttons,
    and other elements have been normalized and enhanced to iron out bugs and make it simple for you to create your award winning site.

        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a> and 
            <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foundation</a> both do a good job but they're too heavy.
    </h1>
    <p>
        They're great for prototyping but every time you start a real, front-facing, project with them you have to overwrite lots of
            designer styles that do nothing to add to the functionality of the website. That's annoying!
    </p>
    <p>
        Responsive has been built with that in mind. It has been specifically designed and coded to be as lightweight as possible to prevent the need to undo styles set by the 
            framework itself and allow developers to write efficient code and speed up development time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Responsive is tiny. The combined CSS and JavaScript is <strong>only 29.5kb minified and gzipped</strong> but there is a lot of functionality built into the framework.
            It's designed to be dropped-in, as-is to your website such as you would with <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">normalize.css</a>.

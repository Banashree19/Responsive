    <h1>Why Responsive?</h1>
    <p>
        Frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation are too design opinionated and heavy. They're great for prototyping but every time
        you start a real, front-facing, project with them you have to overwrite lots of designer styles that do nothing to add to the
        functionality of the website. That costs developers time and money.
    </p>
    <p>
        Responsive has been built with that in mind. It is the result of thousands of hours of real, client driven web development and
        testing; specifically developed to be as lightweight as possible to prevent the need to undo styles set by the framework itself
        and allow developers to write efficient code and lower costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Responsive is tiny. The combined output CSS and JavaScript is <strong>only {{site.buildsize}}kb minified and gzipped</strong> but
        there is a lot of functionality built into the framework with touch, right-to-left language, and accessibility support.
        It's designed to be dropped-in, as-is to your website such as you would with <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" rel="external">Normalize.css</a>.

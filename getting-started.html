                        The simplest and fastest way to get Responsive is to download the precompiled and minified versions of our CSS, and JavaScript.
                        No documentation or original source code files are included.

                    <p>
                        You can also install Responsive with <a href="http://bower.io" rel="external">Bower</a>:
                    </p>
                    <p><code>bower install responsive</code></p>

                    <p>
                        If you are feeling more adventurous and want to tweak Responsive before use you can download the full Sass and JavaScript source
                        directly from Github. This will require the use of <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" rel="external">gulp.js</a> to build.

            <h1>Browser Support</h1>
            <p>
                Responsive is built to work best in the latest desktop and mobile browsers. Everything though has been built with progressive
                enhancement in mind, meaning older browsers might display differently styled, though fully functional, renderings of certain components.
            </p>
            <h3>Supported browsers</h3>
            <p>Specifically, latest versions of the following browsers are supported:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chrome (Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android)</li>
                <li>Internet Explorer (Windows - Latest plus IE9, IE10, WP7/8)</li>
                <li>Firefox (Mac, Windows)</li>
                <li>Opera (Mac, Windows)</li>
                <li>Safari (Mac and iOS only, as the Windows version is being abandoned)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Safari</h2>
            <p>
                Safari prior to v7.1 for OS X and Safari for iOS v8.0 do not calculate percentages properly and will render 12 individual columns defined using the
                <code>col-{range}-1</code> classes slightly narrower than they should be. See <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/issues/40" rel="external">#40</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately other than upgrading your browser there is not much that can be done about this without resorting to hacks to tweak the percentages using JavaScript or by using the
                <code>push-{range}</code> or <code>push-{range}-only</code> classes to offset the last column.
            </p>
            <h2>Internet Explorer 9</h2>
            <p>
                Internet Explorer 9 has no support for <a rel="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/">CSS Transitions</a> and as such all JavaScript plugins that utilize transitions will operate
                without animation.
            </p>

        <hr />
        <section id="accessibility">
            <h1>Accessibility</h1>
            <p>
                Responsive is built using common web standards and has been designed to support Assistive Technology.
                All the default colors have been chosen to conform to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast" rel="external">recommended ratio of 4.5:1</a>
                to ensure that users with low vision or who are color blind are catered for appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                All Responsive's plugins have been built from the ground up to be mouse, touch and keyboard accessible. They also add the appropriate
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" rel="external">ARIA</a> attribution where necessary to ensure that screenreaders can follow
                each plugin's functionality.
            </p>

        <section id="right-to-left">
            <h1>Right-to-Left Languages</h1>
            <p>
                Responsive has built in support for right-to-left languages such as Hebrew or Arabic.
                All aspects of the framework from grid columns to swiping directional behaviour have right-to-left counterparts.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable right-to-left language support add the attribute <code>dir="rtl"</code> to the <code>html</code> tag.

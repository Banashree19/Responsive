                Dejah Thoris related many interesting facts and legends concerning this lost race of noble
                and kindly people. She said that the city in which we were camping was supposed to have been
                a center of commerce and culture known as Korad. It had been built upon a beautiful,
                natural harbor, landlocked by magnificent hills. The little valley on the west front of the
                city, she explained, was all that remained of the harbor, while the pass through the hills
                to the old sea bottom had been the channel through which the shipping passed up to the city's
                gates.

<h1>Responsive CSS</h1>
<p>
    Responsive differs from other CSS frameworks in that it is built specifically not to force opinionated design on the developer.
    Instead it's been jam-packed with useful functionality to allow you to build a truly cross-browser responsive experience.

<p>
    A powerful grid system is included with right-to-left language support built in as standard. Forms, buttons, and other elements
    have also been normalized and enhanced to iron out bugs and make it easier for you to create your site.

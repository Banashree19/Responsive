<p>
    Responsive comes with a series of jQuery plugins and methods that provide common webpage components in a responsive format.
</p>
<p>
    All plugins come with a markup API that allows running the plugin without writing a single line of JavaScript.
    This is Responsive's first class API and should be your first consideration when using the plugins.
</p>
<p>
    When plugins are added to the page
    using this API they will automatically register when loaded dynamically by any method utilizing jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/html/" rel="external">html()</a>
    function.
</p>
<p>Each plugin has also been built to be extensible, providing events that can be tapped into to allow you to further enhance your site.</p>

    <h4>Accessibility</h4>
    <p>
        All Responsive's plugins have been built from the ground up to be mouse, touch and keyboard accessible. They also add the appropriate
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" rel="external">ARIA</a> attribution where necessary to ensure that screenreaders can follow
        each plugin's functionality.
    </p>

    <h4>jQuery</h4>
    <p>
        All the plugins depend on jQuery (this means jQuery must be included before the plugin files).
        Consult the frameworks <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/blob/master/bower.json">bower.json</a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.

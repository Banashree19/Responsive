<h1>Responsive JavaScript Plugins</h1>
<p>
    Responsive comes with a series of jQuery plugins and methods that provide common webpage components in a responsive format.
</p>
<p>Check out the details in each section.</p>
<hr />
<section id="jquery">
    <h1>Powered by jQuery</h1>
    <p>
        All the plugins depend on jQuery (this means jQuery must be included before the plugin files).
        Consult the frameworks <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveBP/Responsive/blob/master/bower.json">bower.json</a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.
    </p>
    <p>Each plugin has also been built to be extensible, providing events that can be tapped into to allow you to further enhance your site.</p>
    <div class="alert" role="alert">
        <h4>Heads Up!</h4>
        <p>
            Within Responsive's Javascript core we have extended jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/html/" rel="external">html()</a> function to
            fire an event: <code>domchanged</code>. This allows the developer to bind to and handle the event and respond to content dynamically loaded
            using that method.
        </p>
    </div>

<section id="accessibility">
    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    <p>
        All Responsive's plugins have been built from the ground up to be mouse, touch and keyboard accessible. They also add the appropriate
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" rel="external">ARIA</a> attribution where necessary to ensure that screenreaders can follow
        each plugin's functionality.
    </p>
</section>
<hr />
<section id="data-api">
    <h1>Data-API</h1>
    <p>
        All plugins come with a data-attribute driven, markup API that allows running the plugin without writing a single line of JavaScript.
        This is Responsive's first class API and should be your first consideration when using the plugins.
        This API works in a similar, yet enhanced way to Bootstraps Markup API.
    </p>
    <p>
        To allow for situations where you might want to turn the functionality off a method has been provided
        that allows the ability to disable the API by unbinding all events on the document namespaced with <var>data-api</var>.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Globally turn off the Responsive Data-API.
$(document).off(".data-api");</code></pre>
    <p>Each plugin can be individually turned off by prefixing the name of the plugin to the namespace.</p>
    <pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Turn off the Responsive Data-API for the carousel plugin.
$(document).off(".r.carousel.data-api");</code></pre>
    <p>
        When plugins are added to the page using this API they will also automatically register when loaded dynamically.
        function.
    </p>

<section id="progam-api">
    <h1>Programmatic API</h1>
    <p>
        As well as the recommended Data-API, Responsive also comes with a Programmatic API that can be called via JavaScript.
        Each plugin runs in the standard jQuery format with a single chainable structure.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Create a modal window targeting and element with the id 'modal-target'
// and immediately show it.
$("&lt;a/&gt;").modal({target: "#modal-target", immediate : true});</code></pre>
</section>
<hr />
<section id="no-conflict">
    <h1>Namespace Collision</h1>
    <p>
        Many jQuery plugins within UI frameworks use the same naming conventions and to prevent namespace collision each plugin has been given the ability to
        reassign it's functionality to a new object via a <code>.noConflict()</code> method call. This allows the two conflicting plugins to exist side by side.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Reassign the Responsive Carousel plugin to a new function name. 
var responsiveCarousel = $.fn.carousel.noConflict();
$.fn.responsiveCarousel = responsiveCarousel;</code></pre>
